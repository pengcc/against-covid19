# Introduction

Frontend project to combine and visualize data collected in [this project](https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020)

Currently we don't have any in production back support for this project, and hence we are using data source from github repo directly. However, we have two data sources depending on the environments:

- [production](https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020/tree/master/data/json)
- [staging/test](https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020-test/tree/master/data/json)

Also please notice that we are using the `raw` version of all these json files, which you could see in code.

## Contribution

Yes please! Feature requests/pull requests are welcome. Please see the [contribution guide](https://github.com/pengcc/against-covid19/tree/develop/contribution)

# Getting Started

## Prerequisite

Please be awared that in order to both run the project locally or build and deploy the project, you should have the following environment well setup on your machine:

- [npm](http://npmjs.com/) version: **10.15.3 or later**
- [python](https://www.python.org/) **version: python 2**

It is recommended to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage their versions on your system.

Python2 required mostly for the purpose of installing dependencies.

Also it is more recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) over npm. We will be using `yarn` throughout this doc

## Run Locally

1. Clone this project
2. Install dependencies by executing the following script

```bash
yarn
```

3. When dependencies are all installed, run the following command

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then you should be able to visit the app under `http://localhost:3001/`

## Build and Compile

```
yarn build
```

## Deploy, CI/CD

When a new pull request is merged into branch develop, that will trigger githup actions to deploy the changes on github pages, which hosts this project app.

# Tech Stack

This is a typical frontend project using typical frontend tech stack:

- react
- redux
- reselect
- typescript
- react-router
- react-intl
- antd
- axios
- moment
- webpack
- sass
- mesh-dev-cli
  - Written by @oozliuoo, used by Kiwi Inc.
- rxjs
  - not used yet, but would like to migrate to it at some point, to better manage all redux actions

# Design

## Ant Design

We are utilizing Ant Design for fast development at this stage. However, we might want to migrate out of it in the future. Hence, we are not directly using them in this app; instead, we are wrapping them by our own React component, and redefine its styles when necessary. This way, it wont make the migration complicated in the future
